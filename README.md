### Hi, I'm Tim!

I'm a software engineer. I'm obsessed with creating maintainable products, helping teams be productive, and just generally making sure everyone is having fun working.

Sometimes I tweet: [@TimHeuett](https://twitter.com/TimHeuett)
More often, I take photos: [@timhugh](https://www.instagram.com/timhugh/)
Very rarely, I chat on LinkedIn (but I'm always happy to connect!): [timheuett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timheuett/)
