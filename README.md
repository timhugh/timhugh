### Hi, I'm Tim!

I'm a software engineer. I'm obsessed with creating maintainable products, helping teams be productive, and just generally making sure everyone is having fun working.

Sometimes I tweet: [twitter.com/timheuett](https://twitter.com/TimHeuett)

More often, I take photos: [instagram.com/timhugh](https://www.instagram.com/timhugh/)

Very rarely, I chat on LinkedIn (but I'm always happy to connect!): [linkedin.com/in/timheuett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timheuett/)
